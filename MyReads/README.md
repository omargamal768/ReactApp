# MyReads Project




## Introduction

As a starting, a static starter code  without any of the React code. My job was be To make App functionality by tracking the books  and by doing search and lokking for books and know the case of the target book ing search and update it


## How to run the project

 download or clone the repository in your computer:

 $ git clone https://github.com/omargamal768/BookApp.git

and follow the instructions below.

In the repository folder: 
* install all project dependencies with 
        npm install
* start the development server with 
        npm start
Please note that the backend server -against which the web app was developped- was provided by Udacity. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods I used to perform necessary operations on the backend:
* `getAll`
* `update`
* `search`


## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of three "shelves" , each of which contains books. The three shelves are:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
The user select the shelf for that book. When the user select a different shelf, the book moves there.
The search page has a text input field that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets the user add the book to their library.
